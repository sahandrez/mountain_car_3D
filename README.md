# Continuous Mountain Car in 3D
* Extension of [Continuous Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCarContinuous-v0/) to 3D.
* Two extensions are available:
  1. The Y-dimension has another sinusoidal curve, similar to the 3D extension 
  of [Taylor, Matthew E., Gregory Kuhlmann, and Peter Stone. "Autonomous transfer for reinforcement learning." AAMAS (1). 2008.](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ai-lab/pubs/AAMAS08-taylor.pdf)
  2. The Y-dimension has no curve. 
* The rendering is still in 2D. Currently, there are no plans to 
extend the rendering to 3D.
